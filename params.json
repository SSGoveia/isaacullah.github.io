{"name":"Computational Archaeology and Neolithic Subsistence Economies","tagline":"Isaac I. Ullah, PhD","body":"### About me\r\n  I am a post-doctoral researcher at Arizona State University, studying the long term effects of human landuse decisions, especially those associated with Neolithic farming and pastoralism. I use a combination of traditional archaeological and geoarchaeological approaches with GIS, computational modeling, and computer simulation to investigate the dynamics of agropastoral socio-natural systems. My work is largely based in a complex adaptive systems theory perspective. \r\n\r\n  In addition to these large human-environment interaction studies, I also study households, and how people arrange and use their domestic spaces. I analyze the spatial patterning of very small artifacts (\"micro-refuse\") recovered from ancient housefloors as a way to get at long-term patterns in domesticity. \r\n\r\n***\r\n### My Research\r\n  As a fun way for you to quickly get a grasp of the types of things I research, I created this wordcloud from the text of my recent publications:\r\n\r\n![Wordcloud for Isaac's research](http://isaacullah.github.io/images/total_wordcloud.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n### My Publications\r\n  Please see my [Google Scholar Citation Index page](http://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Rrg5NlUAAAAJ) for a complete list of my publications, their citation indices, and lists of works that cite them.\r\n\r\nDownloadable PDF's of some of my publications can be found on my [Academia.edu page](https://asu.academia.edu/IsaacUllah).\r\n\r\n***\r\n### My CV\r\n  [Isaac Ullah, CV, Fall 2014 (PDF)](http://isaacullah.github.io/pdf/Isaac_Ullah_CV.pdf)\r\n\r\n***\r\n### Projects\r\n* The Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics Project -- ([medland.asu.edu](http://medland.asu.edu))\r\n\r\n* The Wadi Ziqlab/Wadi Quseiba Project -- ([homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~banning/Ziqlab/](http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~banning/Ziqlab/))\r\n\r\n* Socio-ecological Agent-based Modeling of the Early Bronze Age I of Arslantepe -- (website coming soon!)\r\n\r\n* Kazak-American Talgar Archaeology Project -- ([talgar.sbc.edu/](http://talgar.sbc.edu/))\r\n\r\n***","google":"UA-55626306-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
