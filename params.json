{"name":"Computational Archaeology and Neolithic Subsistence Economies","tagline":"Isaac I. Ullah, PhD","body":"I am a post-doctoral researcher at Arizona State University, studying the long term effects of human landuse decisions, especially those associated with Neolithic farming and pastoralism. I use a combination of traditional archaeological and geoarchaeological approaches with GIS, computational modeling, and computer simulation to investigate the dynamics of agropastoral socio-natural systems. My work is largely based in a complex adaptive systems theory perspective. In addition to these large human-environment interaction studies, I also study households, and how people arrange and use their domestic spaces. I analyze the spatial patterning of very small artifacts (\"micro-refuse\") recovered from ancient housefloors as a way to get at long-term patterns in domesticity. \r\n\r\n As a fun way for you to quickly get a grasp of the types of things I research, I created this wordcloud from the text of my recent publications:\r\n![Wordcloud for Isaac's research](http://isaacullah.github.io/total_wordcloud.png)\r\n\r\nPlease see my [Academia.edu page](https://asu.academia.edu/IsaacUllah) for downloadable PDF's of some of my publications, and my [Google Scholar Citation Index page](http://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Rrg5NlUAAAAJ) to see a list of my publications and works that cite them.\r\n\r\nYou can also have a look at [my CV](http://isaacullah.github.io/pdf/Isaac_Ullah_CV.pdf)","google":"UA-55626306-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
