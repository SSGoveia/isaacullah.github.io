Just returning from the 2015 SAA conference in San Francisco. Attended several interesting sessions featuring digital technologies applications in archaeology. Among these was a symposium entitled, ["OPEN METHODS IN ARCHAEOLOGY: HOW TO ENCOURAGE REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH AS THE DEFAULT PRACTICE"](https://github.com/benmarwick/SAA2015-Open-Methods). With the recent explosion of the usage of digital data and methods in archaeology, there comes a new set of responsibilities and opportunities to maintain/promote transparency, reproducibility, fairness, and equality in the way we do archaeology. The presenters in the symposium shared several examples for how to do this, beyond the "typical" calls for using FOSS software. Some of the more interesting take-home messages included the idea of "scripting" statistical analyses (e.g., in [R mardown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), so that the *entire process* of archaeological analysis is preserved. These "scripts" can then be archived here on GitHub, or, even better, at [figshare](figshare.com), so that they are accessible, citeable, and inter-linkable to the resultant publications and the orignal data. In fact, the archiving of digital methods (either statistical, as above, or [computational](www.openabm.org) ) was a main topic. These parallel the movement to archive digital data (i.e., [tDAR](www.tdar.org), [Open Context](opencontext.org), etc.) and open access publishing, and hopefully will provide the link between the two, which is currently missing in the realm of digital archaeology.
