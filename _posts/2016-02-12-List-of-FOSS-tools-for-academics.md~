# ...and what to use them for!

*All tools available on Linux, most on MacOS and quite a few on Windows too.*

(Links coming soon! For now, Google is your friend.)



## GIS and Image Analysis

- GIS
GRASS - Most powerful, fully-functional FOSS GIS suite. "Heavy lifting" GIS work and scientific geo-spatial analysis.
QGIS - Less powerful, but very functional GIS. Great for web mapping applications and making finished cartographic products.

- Structure from Motion Analysis
Python Photogrammetry Suite - A bit buggy, but it does work. Graphical interface to bundler and PMVS.
OSM-Bundler and MVS/PMVS - Command line driven. Are in PPS anyway, but still useful to know how to do it from scratch.
MVE with MVS-texturing - Another set of command-line tools, taking a slightly different approach than does Bundler (and PPS). I've developed scripts to run these as batches.
OpenDroneMap - Still in development, and not fully functional yet, but promises to be the ultimate all-in-one tool to make rectified aerial photomosaics and DEM's from SfM data clouds extracted from those images.

- Point Cloud Editing and Viewing
MeshLab - The most full-featured point cloud and mesh editor around. A bit of a learning curve, but can do most everything.
CloudCompare - Easier to get into, but more limited than MeshLab
Blender - The 3D modeling mode of Blender can be use to edit meshes and point clouds quite effectively. Many plugins. More geared to digital animation than scientific analysis though.

- Image Analysis/Remote Sensing
Multispec - Great tool for analysis and manipulation of multispectral satellite imagery. Can do clustering.
ImageJ - Great tool for general image manipultion and analysis. A LOT of plugins. Mostly used for medical imaging, but great for analysis of artifacts via imagery.
HyperCube - Another multispectral image analysis tool. Very powerful.
GRASS - GRASS does most satellite imagery analysis things too.
OpenDroneMap - For creating rectified photomosaics from aerial imagery.




## Software Development and Sientific Computing

- Scientific Computing/Statistics
R - Very robust, huge community, lots of modules. 
SciPy - Scientific Python. Growing community, also robust, advantage of huge amount of other Python modules and resources. Possible to chain together with other programs (e.g., GRASS) through native Python API's.
KNIME - Graphical programming is easier to get into than scripting languages like R or Python. Large code-base, many modules for data-mining. Growing user-base. 

- Scientific Computing IDE's
Spyder - Excellent for scientific Python work. Similar to R-Studio.
Jupyter - A different way to get into Scientific Python. Runs in your webbrowser.
R-Studio - The best interface for using R.

- Software Development
Spyder - Great for general Python devel too.
iPython - Great interactive Python shell.
Geany - An ok IDE too.
Eclipse - A must if you are doing Java work. Will work with many other languages, but I find it a bit bloated an unfriendly to use.
Meld - A good "dif" tool to see and merge two versions of a document or script.
RapidSVN - A great tool to manage SVN repositories.
Git - Commandline tools. Needed to move stuff to and from your GitHub repo.




## Plotting and Data Exploration

- Plotting Tools
Veusz - A GUI front-end for MatPlotLib from SciPy. Easy to get your data in, and then create a lot of different kinds of plots. Might be easier for a non-programmer than simply learning Python and MatPlotLib.
XYScan - A cool little tool for grabbing x/y coords of data points from, eg.,plots in PDF papers you downloaded. Might be the only way to get raw data from some publications.
Seaborn - An additional library to make MatPlotLib plotting easier/nicer in SciPy
GGPlot2 - Ditto for R.

- Data Exploration
GGobi - A very cool program to interact with your 2D and 3D scatterplotted data. Not neccessarily for publication plots, but to get to know your data better. Very useful!

- Network Analysis
Cytoscape - Perhaps a bit complex to learn and use, but seems very powerful. Seems to be a large user-base.




## Office and Text

- Word Processing
LibreOffice Writer - Part of the LibreOffice suite. Fully functional replacement for MSWord, including Zotero biliographic manager integration.
AbiWord - Lighter, but still functional. No Zotero integration.

- Bibligraphic Manager
Zotero - Integrates into Firefox, Chrome/Chromium, LibreOffice, and MSWord.

- Spreadsheet
LibreOffice Calc - Stand in for MSExcel. Slick, but limited. 
Gnumeric - More capabilities, better graphics, more plot types, slightly less slick.

- Database
LibreOffice Base - Stand in for MS

- Text editing
Gedit - A basic text editor that does what you want it to. Does require GTK libraries.
Medit - Also good, doesn't require GTK.

- PDF Tools
PDF Shuffler - For moving/deleting pages in a PDF, or mergeing more than one PDF.
Xournal - For annotating PDF's. Can write or draw on the page, and all annotations saved separately. Can export to a condensed PDF with annotations embedded.
GhostScript - Command-line PDF manipulation. Good for batch resize, or quick creation of PDF from other file formats.
DocumentViewer - A basic PDF viewer.

- Web Browsing/development
Firefox - Best FOSS web browser.
Chromium - Open Source version of Chrome.
Bluefish - A GUI html editor.

- Desktop Publishing
Scribus - An all around great tool for making posters, brochures, newsletters, anything that requires mixing graphics and text. Very precise control. A direct stand-in for Adobe Pagemaker.
LibreOffice Impress - More for presentations, but you can make posters, etc. in it too.

- Presentations
LibreOffice Impress - A direct stand-in for MS Powerpoint.
Impressive - A great tool for PDF presentations. Gives you some great interactivity with your slides.




## Graphics and Photography

- Vector Graphics
Inkscape - Direct stand in for Adobe Illustrator. Very functional, and powerful.
LibreOffice Draw - Does vector graphics. More limited than Inkscape, but simpler to use, perhaps.

- Bitmap Graphics
GIMP - Direct stand in for Adobe Photoshop. Very functional and powerful.
ImageMagick - Command line image manipulation. VERY powerful. Excellent for things like batch resize or animated GIF creation.

- Photography
GThumb - Most functional picture viewer/organizer. Linux only. Can do minor edits like rotate or auto-enhance. Really just for viewing images, but does it well.
Darktable - Very powerful photgraphy post-processing suite, including RAW development, collection management, and all sorts of other goodies. Direct stand-in for Adobe Lightroom.
HUGIN - Best panorama sticher out there. Can also do mosaicing and image unwarping.




## Multimedia

- Video Editing
AVI-Demux - Simple program to trim video, extract audio, etc.
Blender - In video editing mode, this is the best non-linear, non-destructive video editor in the FOSS world. Can do everything, including digital stabilization of shaky footage.

- Audio Editing
Audacity - Easy to use, but powerful multitrack audio editor.

- Multimedia Players/Converters
VLC - Will play pretty much any media file.
SoundConverter - To/from pretty much any audio file format. GUI.
Handbrake - GUI video converter. Powerful.
avconv/ffmpeg - Command line tools for video conversion. Very powerful. Useful for making movies from a series of still images or reducing movie file size.
