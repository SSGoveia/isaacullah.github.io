Well, it's that time of year again. Spring semester is over, finals are all graded, and all the undergrads have fled campus. It can mean only one thing for the international archaeologist: time to cram all your gear into the maximum allowed luggage, and hop a plane to your fieldwork site! This year, however, I'm not doing that. I'm moving instead. Seeing all the lovely facebook posts of my friends and colleagues has me feeling quite nostalgic, so I thought I could get in on the fun a bit by sharing my packing list of the things I bring with me when I go do fieldwork overseas. This list is the culmination of 17 years of international archaeological work in Jordan, Spain, Kazkhstan, and Italy. I've whittled it down to just the essentials, and you should be able to fit this into one carry on and one piece of checked luggage - both below the maximum allowable size/weight limits for international air travel. 

My advice is to get a good 30-35 liter field backpack, and to use this as your carry on. Make sure that you pack at least 3 days of clothes, essential toiletries, medicines, electronics, and anything else you can't live without *in your carry on*. At some time, the airlines **will** lose your checked luggage, and you will be very glad you brought extra underwear with you in your cary on. All tools and other heavy items should go in your checked baggage. You might want to consider a wheeled duffel that has some hideaway packpack straps so that you can hoist it on your back if you need to. If you work in some of the remoter places, this will be an essential feature for getting your stuff up and down stairs, over dirt or cobblestone streets, or onto the back of a donkey. 

So, without further ado, here's the list! Check out the notes following for some caveats and addenda.

# Clothing

## Notes

- This is clearly a male-skewed list. Women will likely need a few different items, especially toiletries. Also, in certain countries women may need things like head-scarves, etc. Any specific suggestions from female archaeologists will be very much appreciated!
- The list covers combined general excavation and pedestrian survey. You may not need all items if you are only excavating or only surveying.
- This list is summer-oriented, so adapt for fall or spring fieldwork.
- Plan on doing laundry weekly to biweekly. If you do laundry more frequently, you can bring fewer clothes. Quickdrying clothing (synthetics, merino wool) is especially useful if you are doing that laundry by hand.
- This list contains things that you may not need to bring if you are not in a supervisory position on the dig or survey (especially some of the electronics and things like the 30-meter tape).
- Most toiletry items can be bought on arrival, but it is good to bring enough to get you through a couple days. Have these, and a couple sets of clothes with you in your carry on. Assume that the airline **will** loose your luggage. Because they will. Sooner or later, they will.
