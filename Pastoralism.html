manuscript I am currently writing)</a></span><a name="Intro"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"><a name="Intro">The
archaeology
of
mobile
pastoralists
has been in large part confounded
by researchers’ misconceptions about the nature of mobile
pastoralism as a subsistence system. Researchers often misconstrue
what it means to be a mobile pastoralist, and often do not closely
examine their assumptions about what kinds of things go along with
being a mobile pastoralist. The issue is that mobile pastoralists are
not just mobile, they are also pastoralists (Cribb 1991), and this by
necessity means they are doing different things than people who are
mobile but not pastoralists, or who raise animals but are not mobile.
Accepting this as the most basic dimension of mobile pastoralism will
allow us to examine the interaction of various aspects of mobility
and pastoralism across case studies to gain a greater understanding
of exactly how mobile pastoralists interact with their environment. </a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"><a name="Intro">In
order
for
mobile
pastoral
groups to make pastoral production viable,
they must be flexible. Because the various dimensions of pastoral
landuse are not necessarily formulaically tied to one another, they
cannot be separated into a series of monolithic types. This idea has
not yet been fully integrated into the literature on pastoralists,
and many modern studies still try to classify pastoral peoples into
types such “nomadic”, “semi-nomadic”, or “transhumant”
(eg. Barfield 1993; Bartosiewicz and Greenfield 1999; de Villiers and
Hirtle 2002; FAO 2001; Khazanov 1994, 2001; Khazanov, et al. 2001;
Levy 1992). Although there is some sense in the literature that these
types are fairly fluid, only Cribb (1991) explicitly states that
there exists a continuum between these types. </a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"><a name="Intro">Cribb
discusses
the
variable
ways
that these terms have been employed in
great detail (1991, pp. 18-21) and I will not repeat them here. I
wish to reiterate, however, that the greatest problem with the
typological approach is that the act of typifying necessarily removes
the actions being typified from the context in which they operate
whilst simultaneously simplifying their complex natures to make them
fit the type. This severely limits the scales at which these
behaviors can be studied and is the root of many of the
misconceptions about mobile pastoralism. The issue is that each of
the different parts of a pastoral landuse strategy can be localized
or dispersed, intensified or moderate, seasonal or year-round, and
can be integrated at the household, local group, tribe, or region
(Cribb 1991). The variables dynamically relate to each other as well
as the environment, technology, social structure, and the political
context surrounding the group, and all of these things can vary over
time and space.<br />

</a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"><a name="Intro">One
can
think
of
pastoralism
as single subsistence strategy that
encompasses a very wide range of variation. Much like the well known
forager–collector continuum (Binford 1980) and more complex models
of hunter-gatherer mobility (Kelly 1992; Whallon 2006), we can begin
to deconstruct the idea of pastoral subsistence into a series of
dimensions. Cribb (1991) has so far been the only researcher to
attempt this. He created a nomadic–sedentary continuum for
pastoralists which he compared in a bi-axial plot to another
continuum of the degree of reliance on pastoral production (Cribb
1991, Fig. 2.1). Although he did not specifically dimensionalize
other aspects of pastoral subsistence in this same graphical manner,
he touches on many important aspects that can also be plotted along
similar continua.</a></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"><a name="Intro">The
most
durable
physical
evidence
for highly mobile pastoralists in West
Asia and Africa are circles of stones that once anchored brush
corrals in conjunction with other stone outlined features that are
the remains of temporary dwellings (Banning 1993; Betts 1982, 1992;
Chang and Koster 1986; Cribb 1991; Eddy, et al. 1999; Kinahan 1991;
Sadr 1991; Saidel 2001; Simms 1988; Smith 1983; Andrew B Smith 1992a;
Smith 2005; Zarins 1992). The pattern of settlements across the
landscape has been used to make arguments about the types of pastoral
activities that were occurring in the area (Betts 1982, 1988, 1992).
The soil inside the circles has been found to have a unique chemical
signature, especially greatly elevated phosphate and nitrogen levels,
due to the large amounts of dung and urine that gets concentrated in
them (Winnett 1957). For the same reasons, there are also high
amounts of pollen and phytoliths in these soils (Zohar 1992). Beyond
these circular stone enclosures, one may also find evidence in rock
art and graffito left by ancient nomads, as well as cemeteries and
shrines in very dispersed locations (Köhler-Rollefson 1989a, b). </a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"><a name="Intro">Cribb
(1991)
describes
the
site
of Tepe Tula’i which he argues is a
mobile pastoralist campsite dating to 6,200 BC. He makes this
determination based on the layout and character of the architecture,
which conforms to his model of mobile pastoral dwellings, as well as
faunal evidence. Smith (2005) and Sadr (1997) examine the frequency
of pottery types in southern Africa to differentiate the campsites of
ancient mobile pastoralists from hunter-gatherers. They were then
able to discus the chronology and nature of early pastoralism in the
region. Banning use ethnoarchaeological models to identify the
remains of ancient mobile pastoralists in northern Jordan(Banning
1993, 1995). He was able to identify stone platforms in the upper
layers of the site of Tabaqat al-Buma that may relate to storing milk
products. While these examples show that the archaeology of mobile
pastoralists can be analyzed archaeologically, it is still in general
very difficult to build a picture of how intensely a given area was
utilized by highly mobile pastoralists at a given time in the past
from conventional archaeological arguments alone.</a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"><a name="Intro">On
the
other
end
of
the mobility continuum, it is easier to find
evidence for intensity of pastoralism at more sedentary sites in the
Near East. This has mainly been done through the analysis of faunal
assemblages from major sites. The faunal record from ‘Ayn Ghazal
has been especially amenable to this type of analysis. We can see
trends in herd size, herd composition, and changes in the ratio
between wild and domestic animal remains that indicate that people at
‘Ayn Ghazal and other early Neolithic sites were intensifying their
reliance on domestic flocks and pastoral production through time
(Rollefson 1997; Rollefson and Köhler-Rollefson 1989; Wasse 2002;
Wiedemann, et al. 1999). At ‘Ayn Ghazal this pastoral
intensification combined with other types land-use intensification
and the localized environmental degradation that resulted may have
been the reason why the site was basically abandoned at the end of
the Neolithic period (Behnke 1980; Lancaster and Lancaster 1990). </a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"><a name="Intro">We
can
do
more
with
the archaeological evidence we have for ancient
mobile pastoralists than is allowed under current frameworks of
pastoral archaeology. The types of data that we already collect can
all be used to approximate the location of ancient mobile pastoral
groups on the different plots used in this paper. Herd compositions
can be assessed from faunal analysis, the amount of agricultural
foods consumed can be assessed by paleobotanical analysis, mobility
patterns can be assessed through architectural analysis and
settlement patterns, and exchange of material cultural items can be
assessed by regional typological studies. Using the dimensional
framework presented in this paper allows us to make hypotheses about
ancient pastoral landuse that have explicit test implications.
Because we know how differences in pastoral mobility and production
affect modern landscapes, we can use the heuristic devices presented
in figures 1 thru 7 to compare ancient mobile pastoralists with our
ethnographic and historic cases to draw conclusions about how
different ancient pastoralists were impacting the landscape. </a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;">
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"><a name="Intro">In
general,
the
issue
of
mobile pastoral landuse is complex. There have
been numerous attempts to understand pastoralism in economic, social,
political, and environmental contexts. Most of these attempts suffer
from a lack of organization of the concepts with which they try to
build their cases. The misuse and abuse of jargony terms with regard
to mobility and production are the main culprits here, and this paper
has attempted to address the misuse of these concepts. Thinking of
these phenomena in terms of dimensions of variability aids our
ability to understand how and why different pastoral groups practice
pastoralism differently. </a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"><a name="Intro">When
these
frameworks
are
applied
to ethnographic and historic case
studies, some general patterns become apparent. First, groups who
live in more marginal environments are more residentially mobile,
move further in their seasonal rounds, are more apt towards nomadic
movement of these seasonal rounds through time, are more focused on
pastoral production, and specialize in desert adapted pastoral
species, but are more reliant on groups outside the marginal zone for
both material cultural items and subsistence. More sedentary groups
are found in better environments, and are more prone to agriculture
as a significant portion of their productive strategy, and are less
apt to be nomadic over time. They are also more apt to be self
sufficient in terms of food and material culture. Groups who are more
logistically mobile tend to focus on animals that are not as hardy,
but which are easier to manage. They are not quite as nomadic as the
more residentially mobile pastoral groups, but never-the-less
experience some degree of nomadic drift. They often practice
agriculture as part of their productive strategy, but still rely to
some degree on exchange to round out their diet and fill their
material cultural needs</a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"><a name="Intro">These
frameworks
can
also
help
us assess the potential impacts of different
pastoral landuse strategies on specific environments. One would be
quite correct to state that pastoral land-use can have serious
harmful impacts on the landscape, but this is not always the case.
Some very sensitive marginal environments have supported sustained
pastoral exploitation for very long periods of time. Poor policy and
management decisions emplaced on pastoral peoples by modern states is
acting to upset many of the traditional systems of pastoral
land-tenure and careful territorial buffering that have been used for
centuries as ways of reducing the impacts of intensive pastoralism in
these areas. It is therefore more important than ever to find
evidence of ancient pastoralists and the effects of different types
of pastoral land-use on ancient landscapes. This evidence can help
corroborate the kinds of things we are learning from modern
traditional pastoralists, and help us learn to mitigate the kinds of
degradation we are noticing in marginal rangelands today.</a></p>
