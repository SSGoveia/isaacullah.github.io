I am a post-doctoral researcher at Arizona State University, studying the long term effects of human landuse decisions, especially those associated with Neolithic farming and pastoralism. I use a combination of traditional archaeological and geoarchaeological approaches with GIS, computational modeling, and computer simulation to investigate the dynamics of agropastoral socio-natural systems. My work is largely based in a complex adaptive systems theory perspective.

In addition to these large human-environment interaction studies, I also study households, and how people arrange and use their domestic spaces. I analyze the spatial patterning of very small artifacts ("micro-refuse") recovered from ancient housefloors as a way to get at long-term patterns in domesticity.

### My Research

As a fun way for you to quickly get a grasp of the types of things I research, I created this wordcloud from the text of my recent publications:
