I am currently in the process of establishing a new Computational Archaeology Laboratory here at SDSU. This page provides information about the lab, including the resources we have available and (eventually) research that we are carrying out. The lab is in an early phase, and will be remodeled and furnished (hopefully) by Summer, 2017. When complete, the lab will be a state of the art facility for FOSS GIS, Agent Based Modeling, Imagery Analysis, and other computational approaches in archaeology and beyond. A main focus of research in the lab will be the origins of coupled human and natural systems in the Mediterranean and beyond.

### Lab Information

#### Location: Hardy Tower 62/66.

The lab is on the ground floor of the Hardy Tower building. The easiest way to find it is to enter via the parking lot/loading dock at the rear of the building. You will find the door in the stairwell immediately to your left upon entering. This is the door currently marked as room number 62 (and with a placard that says "Computational Archaeology Lab"). Note that eventually you will also be able to enter through the door currently marked as room 66 from the interior hallway, but not until after the remodeling is completed this summer.

#### Lab Hours: Thursdays, 1-4pm (Spring 2017).

These are the "open lab" hours during which I will regularly be in the lab and availble to answer questions. The lab may be open at other times.

### Current Resources

The lab is currently in "beta" stage, operating with an initial set of equipment and resources. Currently, there are 6 Ubuntu Linux computer workstations with a full complement of FOSS computational analysis tools. These include GRASS GIS, QGIS, Image-J, R, Scientific Python, Python Photogrammetry Toolbox, Open Drone Map, Meshlab, Cloud Compare, NetLogo, RePast, PyABM, and more. These workstations are available to students in my courses to complete assignments. These workstations will remain a core component of the lab as it is upgraded and completed.

#### Future laboratory resources will include:

* A Puget Systems "Peak" HPC workstation. This workstation will contain 44 multithreaded cores for parallel and high-performance computing.
* A full photogrammetry workstation. Including full-frame DSLR and various accessories for photogrametric analysis of artifacts and landscapes, including 3D point-cloud generation via MVS.
* Multispectral Aerial Drone. The drone will carry an RGB camera plus a Near Infra Red camera.
* Sediment Granulometry workstation. This includes a full set of nesting geologic sieves, a mechanical sieve shaker, and a high precision balance.
* USB microscopes. Low-power microscopes for conducting microrefuse analysis or other such tasks.
* Mobile tablet computers for field data collection. 
* Bad-Elf GNSS surveyor high precision bluetooth GPS units.
* Wacom tablets for data entry and digitization

### Major Research Topics

The Compuational Archaeology Lab conducts research in collaboration with the following projects. Please visit these links for more information on each specific project.

* The Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics Project -- ([medland.asu.edu](http://medland.asu.edu))
* The Wadi Ziqlab/Wadi Quseiba Project -- ([homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~banning/Ziqlab/](http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/%7Ebanning/Ziqlab/))
* Socio-ecological Agent-based Modeling of the Early Bronze Age I of Arslantepe -- (website coming soon!)
* Kazak-American Talgar Archaeology Project -- ([talgar.sbc.edu/](http://talgar.sbc.edu/))
* Bova Marina Archaeological Project -- ([www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/bova-marina/](http://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/bova-marina/))

### Recent Events

Recently, the Computational Archaeology Lab hosted the first SDSU Experimental Archaeology Workshop. More information about the workshop can be found in [this post](2017-SDSU-Experimental-Archaeology-Workshop).
